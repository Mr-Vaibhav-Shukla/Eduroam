###### OpenLDAP is an open-source and fast directory server that provides network client with directory services. Client applications connect to OpenLDAP server using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to access organizational information stored on that server.  Given the appropriate access, clients can search the directory, modify and manipulate records in the directory. OpenLDAP is efficient on both reading and modifying data in the directory.
###### OpenLDAP servers are most commonly used to provide centralized management of user accounts. For example, you can create an account in OpenLDAP and if it is connected with mail server, FTP server, Samba server, or any other server, you can use the account to log in to these servers without creating a new account for each server.
