## Education Roaming
### What is Eduroam?
###### Eduroam(education roaming) is an international roaming service for users in research, higher education and further education.
###### It provide researchers, teachers and students easy and secure network access when visiting an institution other than their own.
### How to access Eduroam?
###### Authentication of users is performed by their home institution, using the same credentials as when they access the network locally, while authorization to access the Internet and possibly other resources is handled by the visited institution.
###### User don't have to pay for eduroam.
### How does Eduroam works?
###### Eduroam allows any user from an eduroam participating site to get network access at any institution connected to eduroam. Depending on local policies at the visited institutions, eduroam participants may also have additional resources at their disposal.
###### The user credentials are kept secure because eduroam does not share them with the site you’re visiting. Instead they are forwarded to the user’s home institution, where they can be verified and validated.
###### The system uses a network of servers run by the institutions, and the participating National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) to securely route these requests back to your home institute.  All this happens seamlessly and virtually instantly – all thanks to eduroam!
### How secure is Eduroam?
###### Eduroam is based on the most secure encryption and authentication standards in existence today. Its security by far exceeds typical commercial hotspots.
###### Eduroam requires the use of 802.1x which provides end-to-end encryption to ensure that your private user credentials are only available to your home institution. 
###### The certificate of your home institution is the only point you need to trust regardless of who operates any intermediate infrastructure.
### Does Eduroam monitors or filter access?
###### Eduroam provides authenticated network access at any location where the service is enabled.
###### Each participating organisation offering network access to authenticated users is able to apply its own filtering policies as long as it is clearly informing users about the filtering rules.
### What do we get as an institution?
###### Eduroam provides a single solution that accommodates all the mobile connectivity requirements of an institution – supporting local users connecting to the local network, visitors connecting to the local network and local users connecting to other participating networks.
###### Eduroam removes the need to supply temporary accounts to visiting users, so reducing the administrative and support burden imposed by the ever-growing movement of students and researchers between institutions and countries.
